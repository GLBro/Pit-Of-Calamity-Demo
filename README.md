# Pit-Of-Calamity-Demo
This is a game demo for a project that I am working on called Pit Of Calamity. All code and assets (aside from the font) we made by me as a challenge to understand all aspects of game development, not just the programming side. Full release coming soon, enjoy!

How to play:
1) Download the Pit Of Calamity.zip file
2) Extract the contents from the zip file (right click -> Extract All)
3) Run the application (will only work if the .pck is in the same folder)

For those that wish to look at the inner workings of game, the assets and code can be found in the project folder
